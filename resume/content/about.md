## Professional Experience

> __Engineering Manager ([Lattice](https://lattice.com/))__  
> _January 2022 — Present (San Francisco, CA)_

Leading a team of 10 engineers (mix of SWEs and SREs with experience levels ranging from Junior to Staff) serving an engineering organization of 120 developers and enabling easy, fast, and reliable product development at Lattice on a tech stack composed of TypeScript, GraphQL, React, Relay, and NestJS.

The team’s scope and responsibilities encompass the entire development and release lifecycle, including local dev environments, CI (Github Actions), CD (ArgoCD), build systems and infrastructure, full-stack application frameworks, database migrations, container builds, linters, feature flags, preview environments and canary deployments, testing frameworks and tooling, code policies, observability integrations (Datadog & Sentry), build caching, and developer telemetry.

* Launched and bootstrapped the team from the ground up, collectively set the mission, charter, and technical strategy, established metrics, KPIs, and SLOs, and introduced a continuous planning process for data-driven prioritization and resource allocation to meet the organization's needs.
* Fostering a culture of high performance and collaboration through tailored individual development plans, continuous growth conversations, and performance management, reflected in engagement scores of 100% for Management and Team Climate.
* Rolled out the DX survey across all functions of EPD with a consistent participation rate of 90%+ every six weeks, serving as a roadmap input for my team, a feedback mechanism for engineering teams, and a compass for organizational health for leadership.
* Spearheaded the adoption of order-independent deploys to create a 4h guaranteed instant rollback window by shifting contract compatibility validations from deploy time to build time.
* Championed a 30% reduction in CI spending while fortifying security posture, orchestrating a seamless migration from CircleCI to GitHub Actions with self-hosted runners on AWS EC2. Executed the infrastructure setup in Terraform, allowing the team to focus on shifting CI pipelines and automation.
* Subsequently, invested in CI stability and velocity, resulting in an 80% reduction in build time and a surge in build success rates from 70% to 99% through the adoption of GitHub’s Merge Queue, smart build caching, and flaky test automation.
* Collaborated with IT to migrate the entire Engineering org to M1-powered MacBooks, delivering an out-of-the-box local dev experience that doubled productivity.
* Facilitated the migration of Lattice’s local dev environment to a Homebrew-based setup and the rollout of GitHub Copilot, leading to a 50% increase in developer satisfaction.
* Centralized the support model spanning three teams within Lattice’s Developer Platform, simplifying how developers receive assistance by implementing a Jira-based triage process and consolidated office hours.
* Pioneered the rollout of a Backstage-based developer portal, serving as the central hub and source of truth for developer documentation and service ownership.
* Guided and mentored an engineer on their journey to people management, resulting in a successful promotion to engineering manager within six months.
* Supported Security Engineering while the team was still getting set up by rolling out and integrating FOSSA for SCA, GitHub Advanced Security for SAST, and StackHawk for DAST.
